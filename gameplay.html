                    <p class="rest-of-ps info-block">

                        In the Party interface, tap the space between the Servant portrait and the Servant's stats to select a Craft Essence to equip on that Servant. Craft Essences are maintained per party, so you can have the same Servant with a different Craft Essence equipped in multiple parties or vice versa. Changing the Servant in a slot will automatically move the Craft Essence to the new Servant; however, if you swap 2 Servants who are both in the same party you will to have swap the equipped CEs manually. <br><br>

                        Craft Essences give additional HP, ATK, or both, as well as a special effect. Effect range from simple (increasing damage dealt, decreasing damage taken) to complex (give the rest of the party effects when defeated). Craft Essences also have cost; the rarer the CE, the more cost is needed to equip.<br><br>

                        Craft Essences have levels just like Servants, and they are similarly leveled, by feeding other Craft Essences to strengthen one, increasing its bonus stats. You can Limit Break a CE up to 4 times by merging exactly the same Craft in a synthesis; when you are selecting Crafts to merge, the same Crafts have yellow text as seen on the right to denote a Limit Break is possible. This increases the CE's max level. When fully limit broken, the CE's special effect is enhanced; for example, 1★ CEs that provide a 3% boost will now grant a 5% boost. Refer to individual Craft Essence pages for stats and special effects. <br><br>

                        You can burn Craft Essences in exchange for QP and Mana Prisms based on the rarity of the Craft.<br><br>

                                Command Cards determine the attacks your Servants perform during battle. There are three different card types: Quick, Arts, and Buster. Every player turn, you receive 5 random cards from your frontline's Command Card deck to choose for that turn. Noble Phantasms are extra cards that do not come from the deck and are available for use in addition to the 5 random cards as long as the Servant has a NP Gauge of 100% or higher. <br><br>

                                Each servant possesses 5 Command Cards, and you will be sequentially distributed 5 cards from each servant's respective deck for three turns, so long as you have servants in the frontline; in other words, if you have 3 Servants in the frontline, you will see all 15 individual Command Cards over the course of 3 turns (meaning from Turns 1-3 you will have seen all Command Cards), after which the deck "resets" and is then redistributed to begin another cycle. In a sense this allows the player to keep track of the cards previously dealt in order to predict which cards will be drawn in the following turns before the deck resets.<br><br>

                                Whenever a Servant you control is defeated, the Command Card deck is shuffled. The deck can also be manually shuffled by using Command Shuffle or Royal Card.<br>
